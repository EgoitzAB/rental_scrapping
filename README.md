# Web Scraper for Prague Rental Websites

This project is a web scraper designed to gather data from the three major rental websites in Prague.
The goal is to assist friends and myself in finding rental properties by providing useful data from ads.
It was one of my first scrapers, but is left out for ever, I think.

## Current Progress

The scraper has been implemented for two of three major rental websites of Prague. However, the project will not be further developed.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), a tool for dependency management in Python. You can install it by running the following command:

    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
    ```

4. Once Poetry is installed, install the project dependencies with:

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

5. Activate the virtual environment created by Poetry:

    ```bash
    poetry shell
    ```

6. Now you can run the script with the command:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

Please note that this project requires Python 3.7 or higher.
